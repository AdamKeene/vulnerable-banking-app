# Bank Web App â€“ Class Project

## Project Overview

This is a self-contained web or Android application that simulates a simple online banking system. It enables users to:

- Register a new bank account with an initial balance.
- Log in securely with a username and password.
- View current account balance.
- Deposit or withdraw funds from the account.

The goal of the project is to demonstrate understanding of full-stack development and secure user interactions.
